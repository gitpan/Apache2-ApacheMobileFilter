Apache Mobile Filter: is an implementation of the Apache filter in Perl, The module detects the mobile device and passes the WURFL capabilities on to the other web application as environment variables. It can also be used to resize images on the fly to adapt to the screen size of the mobile device.
A good point to start is: <http://wurfl.sourceforge.net>
I don't try to install in Win32 platform, but I suppose it's run well.
